With the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, people have become extremely concerned with the amount of toilet paper they should be buying. This is straining supply chains. As people have difficult knowing how much toilet paper they should sensible stockpile during these events, there is a predominance of people who either have too much or too little toilet paper.

Luckily this little script will help you quickly decide whether you've got the right amount of toilet paper.

To use this, simply input how many people are in your household where specified on lines 2 and 3, run the script in an R interpreter like RStudio, and voila, it'll immediately tell you how much toilet paper you should stockpile.

How It Works?

This is the really boring technical part about how it works, and is really long, you don't have to read this if you don't want to and is purely out of curiosity.

The number of toilets and people in your household are important choicey stochastic parameters in this equation, what this means is that these factors have a high Dax constant, and as a result they contain a vast quantity of Quark information. This form of information, can be subdivided into Odomeric, and O'Brien constants, from which we can extract an extremely high degree of porosity and interpret our gerturdism and adequately conjectucate the adundance requirements for the Steam resonance.

Once this is computerated, and it must be computerated, as this is a subtley different conditional requirement to being computed or calculated, due to the ideas of Prof Nils Benteen, who devised the jugernaticulous differentials between spleestonian and Sardinian coaxialation to underfurmigate the hydrocelarapherious nurguzmodial grantopse, and how these lartoric dicatamoleric perfectatides are most apsolutant. And it is apsolutant, as this described both being absolutant and progesterin. With these figures, the Carver factor can be extrapolated.

The Carver figure is the key parameter for defining the Crooks parameter, which is derived through reference to an isocelian pentameric digiterian mongosian vector. This returns a normalised parameter which must be made in reference to a diamene table, from which everything else, including Alouettian functions, can derive a factor that involves monetarian dieclastelese turkic pneteric confluences to undergo stochasperic merithydroceles compostables. This returns a snide factor from which the derivation of the number of loganberries one eats can be derived easily.

The number of loganberries eaten is logarithmic to the number of defecations that humans make, and the messiness of those defecations, providing an excellent summary metric for the number of toilet rolls used during a period of time. This value then linked to the number of people, and the 14 day quarantine can be used to derive the number of toilet rolls one needs to stockpile.

And if you got to this part, yes, this script will always return 0 because you need to stop stockpiling toilet paper, because unless you have a really nasty bowel disease where you're defecating hundreds of times a day you don't use that much toilet roll.

STOP BUYING TOILET PAPER!
